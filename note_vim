~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			       Lesson 2 SUMMARY

  1. To delete from the cursor up to the next word type:        dw
  2. To delete from the cursor up to the end of the word type:  de
  3. To delete from the cursor to the end of a line type:       d$
  4. To delete a whole line type:                               dd

  5. To repeat a motion prepend it with a number:   2w
  6. The format for a change command is:
               operator   [number]   motion
     where:
       operator - is what to do, such as  d  for delete
       [number] - is an optional count to repeat the motion
       motion   - moves over the text to operate on, such as  w (word),
		  e (end of word),  $ (end of the line), etc.

  7. To move to the start of the line use a zero:  0

  8. To undo previous actions, type:           u  (lowercase u)
     To undo all the changes on a line, type:  U  (capital U)
     To undo the undos, type:                  CTRL-R
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			       Lesson 3 SUMMARY


  1. To put back text that has just been deleted, type   p .  This puts the
     deleted text AFTER the cursor (if a line was deleted it will go on the
     line below the cursor).

  2. To replace the character under the cursor, type   r   and then the
     character you want to have there.

  3. The change operator allows you to change from the cursor to where the
     motion takes you.  eg. Type  ce  to change from the cursor to the end of
     the word,  c$  to change to the end of a line.

  4. The format for change is:

	 c   [number]   motion

Now go on to the next lesson.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			       Lesson 4 SUMMARY


  1. CTRL-G  displays your location in the file and the file status.
             G  moves to the end of the file.
     number  G  moves to that line number.
            gg  moves to the first line.

  2. Typing  /	followed by a phrase searches FORWARD for the phrase.
     Typing  ?	followed by a phrase searches BACKWARD for the phrase.
     After a search type  n  to find the next occurrence in the same direction
     or  N  to search in the opposite direction.
     CTRL-O takes you back to older positions, CTRL-I to newer positions.

  3. Typing  %	while the cursor is on a (,),[,],{, or } goes to its match.

  4. To substitute new for the first old in a line type    :s/old/new
     To substitute new for all 'old's on a line type	   :s/old/new/g
     To substitute phrases between two line #'s type	   :#,#s/old/new/g
     To substitute all occurrences in the file type	   :%s/old/new/g
     To ask for confirmation each time add 'c'		   :%s/old/new/gc

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		Lesson 5.1: HOW TO EXECUTE AN EXTERNAL COMMAND


   ** Type  :!	followed by an external command to execute that command. **

  1. Type the familiar command	:  to set the cursor at the bottom of the
     screen.  This allows you to enter a command-line command.

  2. Now type the  !  (exclamation point) character.  This allows you to
     execute any external shell command.

  3. As an example type   ls   following the ! and then hit <ENTER>.  This
     will show you a listing of your directory, just as if you were at the
     shell prompt.  Or use  :!dir  if ls doesn't work.

NOTE:  It is possible to execute any external command this way, also with
       arguments.

NOTE:  All  :  commands must be finished by hitting <ENTER>
       From here on we will not always mention it.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		      Lesson 5.2: MORE ON WRITING FILES


     ** To save the changes made to the text, type  :w FILENAME  **

  1. Type  :!dir  or  :!ls  to get a listing of your directory.
     You already know you must hit <ENTER> after this.

  2. Choose a filename that does not exist yet, such as TEST.

  3. Now type:	 :w TEST   (where TEST is the filename you chose.)

  4. This saves the whole file (the Vim Tutor) under the name TEST.
     To verify this, type    :!dir  or  :!ls   again to see your directory.

NOTE: If you were to exit Vim and start it again with  vim TEST , the file
      would be an exact copy of the tutor when you saved it.

  5. Now remove the file by typing (Windows):   :!del TEST
				or (Unix):	:!rm TEST


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		    Lesson 5.3: SELECTING TEXT TO WRITE


	** To save part of the file, type  v  motion  :w FILENAME **

  1. Move the cursor to this line.

  2. Press  v  and move the cursor to the fifth item below.  Notice that the
     text is highlighted.

  3. Press the  :  character.  At the bottom of the screen  :'<,'> will appear.

  4. Type  w TEST  , where TEST is a filename that does not exist yet.  Verify
     that you see  :'<,'>w TEST  before you press <ENTER>.

  5. Vim will write the selected lines to the file TEST.  Use  :!dir  or  :!ls
     to see it.  Do not remove it yet!  We will use it in the next lesson.

NOTE:  Pressing  v  starts Visual selection.  You can move the cursor around
       to make the selection bigger or smaller.  Then you can use an operator
       to do something with the text.  For example,  d  deletes the text.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		   Lesson 5.4: RETRIEVING AND MERGING FILES


       ** To insert the contents of a file, type  :r FILENAME  **

  1. Place the cursor just above this line.

NOTE:  After executing Step 2 you will see text from lesson 5.3.  Then move
       DOWN to see this lesson again.

  2. Now retrieve your TEST file using the command   :r TEST   where TEST is
     the name of the file you used.
     The file you retrieve is placed below the cursor line.

  3. To verify that a file was retrieved, cursor back and notice that there
     are now two copies of lesson 5.3, the original and the file version.

NOTE:  You can also read the output of an external command.  For example,
       :r !ls  reads the output of the ls command and puts it below the
       cursor.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			       Lesson 5 SUMMARY


  1.  :!command  executes an external command.

      Some useful examples are:
	 (Windows)	  (Unix)
	  :!dir		   :!ls		   -  shows a directory listing.
	  :!del FILENAME   :!rm FILENAME   -  removes file FILENAME.

  2.  :w FILENAME  writes the current Vim file to disk with name FILENAME.

  3.  v  motion  :w FILENAME  saves the Visually selected lines in file
      FILENAME.

  4.  :r FILENAME  retrieves disk file FILENAME and puts it below the
      cursor position.

  5.  :r !dir  reads the output of the dir command and puts it below the
      cursor position.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			 Lesson 6.1: THE OPEN COMMAND


 ** Type  o  to open a line below the cursor and place you in Insert mode. **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. Type the lowercase letter  o  to open up a line BELOW the cursor and place
     you in Insert mode.

  3. Now type some text and press <ESC> to exit Insert mode.

---> After typing  o  the cursor is placed on the open line in Insert mode.

  4. To open up a line ABOVE the cursor, simply type a capital	O , rather
     than a lowercase  o.  Try this on the line below.

---> Open up a line above this by typing O while the cursor is on this line.




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Lesson 6.2: THE APPEND COMMAND


	     ** Type  a  to insert text AFTER the cursor. **

  1. Move the cursor to the start of the first line below marked --->.

  2. Press  e  until the cursor is on the end of  li .

  3. Type an  a  (lowercase) to append text AFTER the cursor.

  4. Complete the word like the line below it.  Press <ESC> to exit Insert
     mode.

  5. Use  e  to move to the next incomplete word and repeat steps 3 and 4.

---> This li will allow you to pract appendi text to a line.
---> This line will allow you to practice appending text to a line.

NOTE:  a, i and A all go to the same Insert mode, the only difference is where
       the characters are inserted.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		    Lesson 6.3: ANOTHER WAY TO REPLACE


      ** Type a capital  R  to replace more than one character. **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.  Move the cursor to
     the beginning of the first  xxx .

  2. Now press  R  and type the number below it in the second line, so that it
     replaces the xxx .

  3. Press <ESC> to leave Replace mode.  Notice that the rest of the line
     remains unmodified.

  4. Repeat the steps to replace the remaining xxx.

---> Adding 123 to xxx gives you xxx.
---> Adding 123 to 456 gives you 579.

NOTE:  Replace mode is like Insert mode, but every typed character deletes an
       existing character.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Lesson 6.4: COPY AND PASTE TEXT


	  ** Use the  y  operator to copy text and  p  to paste it **

  1. Move to the line below marked ---> and place the cursor after "a)".

  2. Start Visual mode with  v  and move the cursor to just before "first".

  3. Type  y  to yank (copy) the highlighted text.

  4. Move the cursor to the end of the next line:  j$

  5. Type  p  to put (paste) the text.  Then type:  a second <ESC> .

  6. Use Visual mode to select " item.", yank it with  y , move to the end of
     the next line with  j$  and put the text there with  p .

--->  a) this is the first item.
      b)

  NOTE: You can also use  y  as an operator:  yw  yanks one word,
        yy  yanks the whole line, then  p  puts that line.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			    Lesson 6.5: SET OPTION


	  ** Set an option so a search or substitute ignores case **

  1. Search for 'ignore' by entering:  /ignore <ENTER>
     Repeat several times by pressing  n .

  2. Set the 'ic' (Ignore case) option by entering:   :set ic

  3. Now search for 'ignore' again by pressing  n
     Notice that Ignore and IGNORE are now also found.

  4. Set the 'hlsearch' and 'incsearch' options:  :set hls is

  5. Now type the search command again and see what happens:  /ignore <ENTER>

  6. To disable ignoring case enter:  :set noic

NOTE:  To remove the highlighting of matches enter:   :nohlsearch
NOTE:  If you want to ignore case for just one search command, use  \c
       in the phrase:  /ignore\c <ENTER>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			       Lesson 6 SUMMARY

  1. Type  o  to open a line BELOW the cursor and start Insert mode.
     Type  O  to open a line ABOVE the cursor.

  2. Type  a  to insert text AFTER the cursor.
     Type  A  to insert text after the end of the line.

  3. The  e  command moves to the end of a word.

  4. The  y  operator yanks (copies) text,  p  puts (pastes) it.

  5. Typing a capital  R  enters Replace mode until  <ESC>  is pressed.

  6. Typing ":set xxx" sets the option "xxx".  Some options are:
  	'ic' 'ignorecase'	ignore upper/lower case when searching
	'is' 'incsearch'	show partial matches for a search phrase
	'hls' 'hlsearch'	highlight all matching phrases
     You can either use the long or the short option name.

  7. Prepend "no" to switch an option off:   :set noic

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		       Lesson 7.1: GETTING HELP


		      ** Use the on-line help system **

  Vim has a comprehensive on-line help system.  To get started, try one of
  these three:
	- press the <HELP> key (if you have one)
	- press the <F1> key (if you have one)
	- type   :help <ENTER>

  Read the text in the help window to find out how the help works.
  Type  CTRL-W CTRL-W   to jump from one window to another.
  Type    :q <ENTER>    to close the help window.

  You can find help on just about any subject, by giving an argument to the
  ":help" command.  Try these (don't forget pressing <ENTER>):

	:help w
	:help c_CTRL-D
	:help insert-index
	:help user-manual
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		      Lesson 7.2: CREATE A STARTUP SCRIPT


			  ** Enable Vim features **

  Vim has many more features than Vi, but most of them are disabled by
  default.  To start using more features you should create a "vimrc" file.

  1. Start editing the "vimrc" file.  This depends on your system:
	:e ~/.vimrc		for Unix
	:e ~/_vimrc		for Windows

  2. Now read the example "vimrc" file contents:
	:r $VIMRUNTIME/vimrc_example.vim

  3. Write the file with:
	:w

  The next time you start Vim it will use syntax highlighting.
  You can add all your preferred settings to this "vimrc" file.
  For more information type  :help vimrc-intro

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			     Lesson 7.3: COMPLETION


	      ** Command line completion with CTRL-D and <TAB> **

  1. Make sure Vim is not in compatible mode:  :set nocp

  2. Look what files exist in the directory:  :!ls   or  :!dir

  3. Type the start of a command:  :e

  4. Press  CTRL-D  and Vim will show a list of commands that start with "e".

  5. Type  d<TAB>  and Vim will complete the command name to ":edit".

  6. Now add a space and the start of an existing file name:  :edit FIL

  7. Press <TAB>.  Vim will complete the name (if it is unique).

NOTE:  Completion works for many commands.  Just try pressing CTRL-D and
       <TAB>.  It is especially useful for  :help .

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			       Lesson 7 SUMMARY


  1. Type  :help  or press <F1> or <HELP>  to open a help window.

  2. Type  :help cmd  to find help on  cmd .

  3. Type  CTRL-W CTRL-W  to jump to another window.

  4. Type  :q  to close the help window.

  5. Create a vimrc startup script to keep your preferred settings.

  6. When typing a  :  command, press CTRL-D to see possible completions.
     Press <TAB> to use one completion.







~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  This concludes the Vim Tutor.  It was intended to give a brief overview of
  the Vim editor, just enough to allow you to use the editor fairly easily.
  It is far from complete as Vim has many many more commands.  Read the user
  manual next: ":help user-manual".

  For further reading and studying, this book is recommended:
	Vim - Vi Improved - by Steve Oualline
	Publisher: New Riders
  The first book completely dedicated to Vim.  Especially useful for beginners.
  There are many examples and pictures.
  See https://iccf-holland.org/click5.html

  This book is older and more about Vi than Vim, but also recommended:
	Learning the Vi Editor - by Linda Lamb
	Publisher: O'Reilly & Associates Inc.
  It is a good book to get to know almost anything you want to do with Vi.
  The sixth edition also includes information on Vim.
